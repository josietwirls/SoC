# FPGA Bop It Game

A reaction-based game implementation on the Nexys4 DDR FPGA board, recreating the classic "Bop It" experience.

## Overview

This project implements a progressively challenging reaction game where players must quickly perform the correct action in response to audio and visual prompts.

## Hardware

- **FPGA Board**: Nexys4 DDR
- **System**: Chu's MMIO Sampler System (hardware cores and drivers)
- **Peripherals Used**:
  - ADXL362 Accelerometer (SPI)
  - Debounced Buttons
  - Switches
  - Seven-Segment Display
  - LEDs
  - DDFS Audio Synthesis

## Game Controls

- **Button 0**: Start game / "Bop It"
- **Switch 0**: "Pull It" (flip switch to ON position)
- **Board Tilt**: "Twist It" (tilt board approximately 30 degrees)

## Features

- Three distinct input types with edge detection
- Wrong action detection (game ends if you do the wrong move)
- Progressive difficulty - reaction time decreases as score increases
- Distinctive audio patterns for each action
- Real-time score display
- High score tracking
- Visual feedback via LEDs and seven-segment display

## Gameplay

1. Press Button 0 to start
2. Perform the prompted action before time runs out
3. Game speeds up with each successful action
4. Game ends on timeout or wrong action
5. Try to beat your high score!

## Timing

- **Initial reaction time**: 3000ms
- **Time decrease**: 150ms per successful action
- **Minimum reaction time**: 800ms
- **Difficulty peaks** around score 15

## Audio Cues

- **Bop It**: Two quick beeps (beep-beep)
- **Pull It**: Rising three-note scale (do-re-mi)
- **Twist It**: Warbling alternating tones (wah-wah-wah)
- **Success**: High-pitched confirmation tone
- **Game Over**: Low failure tone

## Display

- **Left side (digits 7-4)**: Action prompt ("bOP", "PULL", "turn")
- **Right side (digits 3-0)**: Current score / High score

## Implementation Details

The game uses a finite state machine with three states: IDLE, PLAYING, and GAME_OVER. Input detection uses edge-triggered events to ensure accurate, single-fire responses. The accelerometer reads 3-axis acceleration data and compares against a 0.5g threshold for tilt detection.
